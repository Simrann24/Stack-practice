A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Here are some of the key advantages of using a stack:

1.) Simplicity and Ease of Implementation
Stacks are simple to implement using arrays or linked lists.
The operations push, pop, and peek (or top) are straightforward, requiring only a few lines of code.

2.)Efficient Memory Management
Stacks are dynamically managed, meaning they can grow and shrink as needed. This can result in efficient memory utilization.
Since only the top element of the stack is accessible, no memory is wasted on elements that are not currently needed.

3.) Helps in Reversing Data
Stacks are ideal for reversing data since the last element added is the first one to be removed. For example, they are used in reversing strings or evaluating postfix expressions.

4.) Supports Recursive Algorithms
Stacks can be used to simulate recursion. When a function calls itself, the call stack stores the return address, local variables, and parameters, making recursion possible.

5. Backtracking Algorithms
Stacks are commonly used in backtracking algorithms, such as finding paths in a maze, solving puzzles like Sudoku, and the depth-first search (DFS) in graphs.
The stack keeps track of the choices made at each step, and when a dead end is reached, it can backtrack to the previous state.
